I began writing this project aftger my brother asked me to look into sneaker bots. I found a youtube video that describe using 
webscraping to gather inforamtiuon related to sneaker prices. As an introduction for me into web scraping I thougth I would 
attempt to scrape the Market watch webstire. The process took about 3 weeks, 2 of which could have been avoided if I had went
directly to the BS4 docs. Feel free to use the market scraper in any way you like. 


Mindless rambling ....

= (, my old read me that had all this info got deleted. SAD. 

The final solution is contained in the file MARKET_scraper.py. 
My plan it to next automate an email every morning to subscribers, I'll get to that after I undertake the next project
(its going to be grand!!!). Still pretty bummed my old read me got deleted. LEARN TO USE GIT!!!!
