= (, my old read me that had all this info got deleted. SAD. 

At least I deliverd on my promise to complete this project. The final solution is contained in the file MARKET_scraper.py. 
My plan it to next automate an email every morning to subscribers, I'll get to that after I undertake the next project
(its going to be grand!!!). Still pretty bummed my old read me got deleted. LEARN TO USE GIT!!!!
